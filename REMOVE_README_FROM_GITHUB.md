# How to Remove README from GitHub

## Option 1: Remove via GitHub Website (Easiest - No Git needed)

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/yourusername/GoShopMe
2. Click on the `README.md` file
3. Click the **trash can icon** (🗑️) or the **Delete** button at the top right
4. Type a commit message like: "Remove README.md"
5. Click "Commit changes"

Done! The README is now removed.

## Option 2: We'll Remove It When Setting Up Git

If you prefer, I can remove it when we connect your local repository to GitHub. Just let me know your GitHub repository URL and I'll handle it.

**After removing the README, please restart Cursor so Git is recognized, then let me know and I'll complete the setup!**
