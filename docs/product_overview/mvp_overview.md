# GoShopMe MVP Overview
## AI-First Personal Shopper

## 1. MVP VISION

GoShopMe is an AI-first shopping assistant where users turn outfits they see into confident purchases—alone or together with friends—without endless searching.

AI is not an add-on.

Chat (1:1 and group) is the core interface.

## 2. THE CORE PROBLEM WE SOLVE

Users frequently:
• See outfits on social media, in real life, or on friends
• Want the same item or the best alternative
• Need the right size
• Want the lowest price
• Want help deciding (often with friends)

Current platforms force:
• Endless scrolling
• Manual price comparison
• Filters that don't help matching items
• External messaging apps for opinions

## 3. TARGET USER (MVP)

• Fashion-interested shoppers (primarily women, 16–50)
• Heavy Instagram / TikTok users
• Screenshot outfits regularly
• Ask friends for opinions before buying
• Time-poor, price-aware

Creators and merchants are not end-users in MVP
(creators = Phase 2, merchants = backend only).

## 4. CORE ENTRY POINTS (ONLY THESE)

### 4.1 Upload Image or Video (Primary)
• Screenshot
• Photo
• Short video

### 4.2 Tap Any Product
• Every product tap opens chat
• No static product detail pages

### 4.3 Share to Group Chat
• User can invite friends to a group chat
• Friends can view items, react, comment, and vote
• AI participates in the group chat

## 5. AI CORE CAPABILITIES (MVP SCOPE)

### 5.1 Visual Understanding
• Image search
• Video search
• Outfit decomposition:
  o Top
  o Bottom
  o Shoes
  o Accessories (if visible)

### 5.2 Matching & Alternatives

For each detected item, AI returns:
• Exact match (if available)
• Closest visual alternatives
• Budget-friendly alternatives

### 5.3 Mix Proposals (KEY DIFFERENTIATOR)

AI can:
• Keep one premium anchor item
• Replace the rest with cheaper options
• Optimize total outfit price
• Source items from different merchants

### 5.4 Product-Context Intelligence

From any product:
• Find matching top / bottom
• Find matching accessories
• Find same item in another color
• Find similar items at better price

## 6. RESULT RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 6.1 Hard Limit

### 6.2 Ranking Priority (EVERYWHERE)

1. Exact size availability
2. Lowest price across all merchants
3. Exact match
4. Closest visual similarity
5. Brand relevance (soft signal)

Users never need to compare prices manually.

## 7. CHAT AS THE CONTROL LAYER

### 7.1 1:1 Chat (Default)

Used to:
• Clarify the same outfit
• Refine size, color, price
• Switch logic (exact vs cheaper vs mix)

Chat is focused, not open-ended styling.

## 8. COMMERCE FLOW (MVP)
