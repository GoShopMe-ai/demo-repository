# Marketplace vs Affiliate Model

## GoShopMe Operating Model

## 1. Core Principle
GoShopMe operates a primary marketplace model, complemented by a fallback affiliate model.
• Marketplace = default
• Affiliate = exception
• Users must always have a GoShopMe profile
• AI remains the central interface in both cases

## 2. Marketplace Model (Primary)

### What "Marketplace" Means in GoShopMe
GoShopMe is a managed marketplace, not a logistics provider.
The platform:
• Integrates with merchants via APIs / feeds
• Aggregates merchant product catalogs
• Owns:
  o Discovery
  o AI recommendations
  o Cart logic
  o Checkout orchestration
  o Order visibility
  o Returns initiation
  o Customer support layer
Merchants:
• Ship products directly to customers
• Handle:
  o Fulfillment
  o Physical delivery
  o Warehousing
This is a platform-controlled shopping experience, not dropshipping.

### Marketplace Capabilities
Merchant integrations include:
• Product catalog ingestion
• Inventory & availability
• Pricing updates
• Order status
• Returns management APIs
• Tracking information
User experience:
• One GoShopMe profile
• Unified AI chat
• One cart
• One order history
• One returns flow (even if executed by merchants)

### Marketplace Revenue Model
• Platform commission on sales
• User subscriptions (weekly / monthly / annual, with free trial)
• Long-term: premium merchant services

## 3. Affiliate Model (Fallback Only)

### When Affiliate Is Used
The affiliate model is activated only if:
• The item is not available in integrated merchant catalogs
• The AI cannot source an equivalent through marketplace inventory
Affiliate is not a browsing mode.
It is a last-resort fulfillment option.

### How the Affiliate Flow Works
1. User is logged into GoShopMe
2. AI performs an online search
3. AI presents external options
4. User is:
  o Informed the item is external
  o Forwarded to the merchant website
5. User completes checkout on the merchant site
6. GoShopMe earns commission via:
  o Affiliate links
  o Partner agreements
Important:
• User must already have a GoShopMe profile
• The AI context and intent originate inside GoShopMe
• GoShopMe does not own checkout or post-purchase flows in this case

### Affiliate Model Limitations (By Design)
• No native checkout
• No unified returns
• Limited order tracking
• Partial loss of conversion data
These limitations are accepted only to avoid blocking the user from finding a product.

## 4. Marketplace vs Affiliate — Clear Comparison

| Dimension | Marketplace (Primary) | Affiliate (Fallback) |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Default mode | Yes | No |
| User profile required | Yes | Yes |
| Product source | Merchant APIs | Open web |
| Checkout | Platform-orchestrated | Merchant website |
| Shipping | Merchant | Merchant |
| Returns | Platform-managed via APIs | Merchant-managed |
| Order tracking | Unified | Limited / external |
| Commission | Platform commission | Affiliate commission |
| AI learning loop | Full | Partial |
| Strategic value | Core business | Coverage only |

## 5. Why This Hybrid Model Matters
• Marketplace ensures:
  o Control
  o Data
  o AI optimization
  o Defensibility
• Affiliate ensures:
  o Inventory completeness
  o Zero dead-ends for users
  o Better user trust ("I can always find it")
Affiliate extends coverage, but does not define the business.

## 6. Strategic Positioning
• GoShopMe is not an affiliate-first platform
• GoShopMe is not a logistics company
• GoShopMe is an AI commerce platform that:
  o Aggregates supply
  o Orchestrates transactions
  o Lets merchants ship directly
  o Falls back to affiliate only when necessary

## 7. One-Line Positioning
GoShopMe is an AI-powered shopping marketplace with merchant integrations, using affiliate flows only as a fallback when inventory is unavailable.
